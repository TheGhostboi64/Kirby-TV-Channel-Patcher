# Kirby-TV-Channel-Patcher (Unix/Linux Edition)
Patches the Kirby TV Channel to StriimNetwork's domains. Later will be updated to patch their other channels
This is currently in development, so the golang files are placed in the source code just like in the original project.
Made this for Linux people that don't have a Windows Computer or something that can run .exe or .go files.
Release will be coming soon, so keep an eye out for it.
